# BlogForge UX Improvements — batch plan

Source: the 18-item UX review (compose, draft editor, voice/onboarding/settings, cross-cutting). Each batch is one shippable PR (tests green + deployed) before the next starts.

## Batch 1 — Navigation & quick wins ✅ (PR pending)
- [x] #9 Top-nav **Drafts** + primary **Compose** links with active highlighting (`AppShell.tsx`, `index.css` aria-current)
- [x] #3 `KeysBanner` → Settings → Provider API keys (drop removed `/admin` + "ask an admin"); already Tanzu-aware
- [x] #5 Login recourse copy (`not_allowed`/`github_not_configured`) + hide the dead retry button when unconfigured
- [x] #14 Global `prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out

## Batch 2 — Shared primitives (foundation for later batches)
- [x] #15 `ConfirmDialog` + `useConfirm` (promise-based, focus-trapped); `.nb-btn-danger`; replaced native `confirm()` (Drafts/Trash/Settings/SamplesList/SourcesCard); retired orphaned `DeleteDraftDialog`. (2a)
- [x] #7 `ErrorBoundary` at root + global 401 handling in `api/client.ts`. (2a) — *toast/notification context deferred to a later batch where success feedback is wired (5/6).*
- [x] #13 `useDialogA11y` (focus trap + Escape + restore focus) applied to RepurposePanel/HeadlineLab/LintPanel; ModePicker → radiogroup. (2b)
- [ ] *Deferred:* shared `ErrorBanner` + dedup of the per-screen red banners → folded into Batch 6 polish.

## Batch 3 — Data-loss & save model (critical) ✅
- [x] #1 `MarkdownEditor` rewritten: debounced **autosave** + **guard** (never clobbers unsaved edits; ignores the save echo) + per-section save status + `beforeunload`; Save button retired. Inline-AI edits now persist (they autosave). Backend `save_section` gains `create_version` (autosave passes false after the first session save → no version-history spam). Tests: web autosave/guard + backend create_version.
- [x] **3b restore prior version** — *already built* (`SectionVersionHistory` + `onRevert` + `revert_section_version`, behind the per-section **History** link). Surfacing it better folds into Batch 6 discoverability.

## Batch 4 — Onboarding & first-run
- [ ] #2 first-run setup checklist on Drafts (key/Tanzu → voice → first piece)
- [ ] #4 pre-flight provider/model guard in compose (disable run + inline hint)
- [ ] #12 Distill clarity + confirm-before-overwrite of hand edits
- [ ] #17 voice concepts: explain "exemplar", single persona save model, key validation feedback

## Batch 5 — Generation feedback & recovery
- [ ] #6 long-op feedback (elapsed/cancel) for hero/repurpose/fact-check/distill; honest express busy labels
- [ ] #8 bulk-compose partial-failure recovery ("compose remaining")
- [ ] #11 `propose` mode actually generates an outline (or merge with blank)

## Batch 6 — Lists, discoverability & polish
- [ ] #16 Drafts list: sort control + per-draft voice pill + SSE auto-reconnect
- [ ] #10 persistent tools affordance (inline AI / repurpose / headline lab discoverability)
- [ ] loading skeletons on list/settings/admin routes; compose cost/length summary surfaced

## Batch 7 — Docs & smaller wins
- [ ] #18 README rewrite (GitHub OAuth + per-user keys; drop email/password + `/admin` keys)
- [ ] `Template.provider` type widened to include `tanzu`/`claude-cli`; topic/title label consistency; section-reorder optimistic UI + surfaced errors

## Queued (separate, pre-approved)
- [ ] Built-in **Blog post** format, default in voice-profile mode (`voice/pack.py` materialize + compose defaults)
